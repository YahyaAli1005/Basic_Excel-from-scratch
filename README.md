This Excel project showcases basic data analysis skills using a dataset created from scratch with mostly the formula RANDBETWEEN. I used formulas like SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, IF, VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP to answer business questions and perform data summarization. I also created a Pivot Table and Pivot Chart to visualize sales by region and category, demonstrating key Excel functions used in data analysis.
