# Basic_Excel-from-scratch
This project is a foundational Excel workbook created to build and demonstrate essential spreadsheet skills. It includes a structured dataset featuring employee and sales-related information, and applies commonly used formulas to perform basic analysis. Within the workbook, formulas like SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, IF, and VLOOKUP are used to explore, clean, and extract insights from the data.

The goal of this project is to strengthen familiarity with Excel functions and data handling, forming a solid base for more advanced analytics tools such as Power BI or Python. It reflects a practical starting point for anyone preparing for data-focused roles.
